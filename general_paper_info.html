            <h2>Overview of Current Affairs (General Paper).</h2>
            <p>
                Below is a synthesized review of current affairs in Nigeria with a focus on Bola Tinubu’s government and how its policies and events are impacting the Federal Capital Territory (FCT):</p>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>1. Economic and Fiscal Reforms Under President Tinubu</h2>
            <p>
                Bola Tinubu’s administration—since his inauguration in May 2023—has launched a series of sweeping economic reforms designed to “shock” the economy into a more sustainable path. Key measures include:
            </p>
            <h3>i. Removal of Fuel Subsidies and Currency Devaluation:</h3>
            <p>
                Tinubu ended a long-standing fuel subsidy (previously costing the government about US$10 billion a year), a move that has been hailed by international institutions like the World Bank as necessary for fiscal consolidation. However, the sudden removal led to panic buying at pump stations and contributed to an environment of surging inflation. The national currency, the naira, has suffered steep devaluation (losing over 70% of its value against the dollar), which has eroded the purchasing power of many Nigerians. These economic shock therapies are part of what Tinubu describes as necessary to correct long-standing market distortions—even though they have triggered widespread cost-of-living pressures across the country.
            </p>
            
            <h3>ii. Controversial Tax Reform Proposals:</h3>
            <p>
                One of the flagship reforms is a tax overhaul aimed at streamlining tax codes and increasing government revenue. A key point of contention is the proposed reallocation of Value Added Tax (VAT) revenue: under Tinubu’s plan, states (including the FCT) that generate more VAT would receive a larger share of revenue. Critics argue that such a model may exacerbate the north–south economic divide, as more populous northern states fear they will lose out in the revenue-sharing formula. Although the debate is intense at the national level, it also affects Abuja (in the FCT) because as the seat of federal power, the capital is both a revenue hub and a site of policy demonstration.
            </p>
            
            <h3>iii. Telecom Tariff Hike and Labor Protests:</h3>
            <p>
                Concurrently, the government-approved 50% hike in telecommunications tariffs has sparked nationwide protests led by major labor unions. These measures, justified by the Tinubu administration as necessary to counter high inflation and stabilize the economy, have added to the public’s economic discontent—a sentiment felt strongly in the FCT where many government employees and urban professionals are particularly affected by rising living costs.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Impact on the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)</h2>
            <p>
                As the administrative heart of Nigeria, Abuja and the broader FCT are directly influenced by Tinubu’s policies and political developments:
            </p>
            <h3>i. Administration and Service Delivery:</h3>
            <p>
                The FCT Administration, led by Minister Nyesom Wike (appointed by Tinubu in August 2023), is responsible for managing urban infrastructure, public services, and revenue collection in the capital. Recent initiatives focus on improving fiscal transparency, crowd control, and infrastructure repair (for example, tackling illegal structures and revenue leakages). However, economic hardships stemming from Tinubu’s reforms—such as high inflation and a weakened naira—have strained service delivery and raised public expectations for rapid improvements in urban amenities.
            </p>
            <h3>ii. Public Safety and Urban Events:</h3>
            <p>
                A tragic recent incident in the FCT involved stampedes at Christmas charity events in Abuja, which claimed several lives, including those of children. These events have been linked to poor crowd management and reflect the broader impact of Nigeria’s economic challenges on social gatherings and public order in the capital. In the aftermath, authorities in Abuja have moved to require prior permission for such events in order to enforce better safety standards. This incident underscores how fiscal austerity and rising prices are affecting daily life in the FCT.
            </p>
            <h3>iii. Electoral and Political Developments:</h3>
            <p>
                The 2023 presidential election in the FCT, with results closely watched for its symbolic significance in Nigeria’s capital, is another focal point. While Tinubu’s overall victory was declared nationwide, local election dynamics in the FCT illustrate how political loyalties and electoral performance in the capital continue to shape the broader narrative of his government’s legitimacy and its challenges from opposition groups.
            </p>
            <h2>3. Broader Political and Social Context</h2>
            <p>
                Tinubu’s government has also been marked by high-profile ministerial appointments and controversial decisions that resonate in the FCT:
            </p>
            <h3>i. High-Profile Appointments and Nepotism Concerns:</h3>
            <p>
                Among Tinubu’s recent appointments is the nomination of figures such as Oyetunde Oladimeji Ojo (head of the Federal Housing Authority) and the placement of experienced figures in key economic and security roles. Such decisions have sometimes raised accusations of nepotism and cronyism, which are hotly debated in the FCT’s media and among civil society groups.
            </p>
            <h3>ii. Security and Regional Foreign Policy:</h3>
            <p>
                Tinubu’s calls for military intervention in regional crises (e.g., in Niger) and his broader security policies have implications for the FCT. As the federal capital and center of national security apparatus, Abuja is a key site for both the coordination of these policies and the public’s response. Opposition to these moves, combined with domestic protests over economic reforms, contributes to a charged political atmosphere in the FCT.
            </p>
            <h3>iii. Cultural and Environmental Policies:</h3>
            <p>
                Other reforms—such as the upcoming ban on single-use plastics—illustrate Tinubu’s government attempting to address environmental issues. Although such measures are less immediately controversial than fiscal policies, they compete for public attention amid widespread economic hardship, especially in urban centers like Abuja where both economic and environmental challenges intersect.
            </p>
        
            </p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Current affairs with respect to Bola Tinubu’s government are characterized by a bold, often controversial reform agenda that includes drastic fiscal measures, tax system overhauls, and security and administrative restructuring. In the Federal Capital Territory, these national policies translate into direct challenges for urban governance, public service delivery, and social stability. The FCT faces a dual burden: as the nerve center of federal administration, it must implement reforms amid tight fiscal constraints and economic hardship, while also serving as the symbolic stage for the country’s evolving political landscape. Public protests, infrastructure challenges, and administrative controversies—all against the backdrop of Tinubu’s ambitious but divisive policies—define the current affairs affecting both the national government and the FCT.

This review integrates multiple recent developments from international news outlets (Reuters, The Guardian, Financial Times) and official sources, reflecting the complex interplay between Tinubu’s reform measures and their localized impact on Nigeria’s capital.
